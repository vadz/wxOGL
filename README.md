wxWidgets Objects Graphics Library
==================================

This is a slightly modernized version of the original wxOGL library written by
Julian Smart in the last millennium, i.e. a version which can be compiled with
a modern C++ compiler and use wxWidgets 3.x or later.


Building
--------

Under Unix, use CMake to build as usual. The library can be built as either a
static or shared library using the standard CMake `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` variable.

Under Windows, MSVS project files will be provided soon.


Using
-----

See ogledit sample. Some documentation is available in LaTeX format.
